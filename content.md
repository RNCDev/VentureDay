### 9:00am – 9:30am
**Roland Kolbeck**

Spirovant is revolutionizing gene therapy for respiratory diseases. Our transformative technology addresses potency challenges in gene therapy by administering AAV with Augmenter directly to the lungs. The clinical-stage lead program, SP-101, is the first and only inhaled AAV developed with an inhaled Augmenter (doxorubicin) that enhances transgene expression by 100 - 1,000x. This technology targets the unmet needs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who do not benefit from small molecule modulators.

### 9:30am – 10:00am
**Yael Mosse**

We are developing a class of cancer drugs with significant improvements over standard treatments. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are one of the fastest-growing drug classes in oncology, combining monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs. We aim to expedite the development of a first-in-class ALK-directed ADC for pediatric cancers, particularly neuroblastoma, based on ALK protein expression in tumors but not in normal tissues.

### 10:00am – 10:30am
**Will Bailis**

Our breakthrough technology isolates rare therapeutically effective lymphocytes, such as B and T cells, using label-free sorting. This platform enables high-throughput purification of B cells and selection of potent T cells for adoptive therapy without the need for additional cell culture. This technology advances the development of monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cell therapies.

### 10:30am – 11:00am
**Yi Xing**

Yi Xing, PhD, established the Center for Computational and Genomic Medicine at CHOP in 2018. His lab has pioneered a long-read RNA sequencing platform that comprehensively profiles changes and variations in RNA molecules, aiding in the timely diagnosis of genetic diseases with improved accuracy.

### 11:00am – 12:00pm
**LUNCH**

### 12:00pm – 12:30pm
**Jonathan Miner**

There are over 300 million people with rare genetic diseases, and many of those diseases are currently untreatable. The Miner laboratory generates model systems, gene therapies, and small molecular inhibitors designed for treating some of the most devastating human autoimmune diseases caused by single-gene mutations. By defining the underlying mechanisms of those diseases, and by developing novel therapeutics, we have created new opportunities for the treatment of autoimmunity, cancer, and premature cellular senescence / aging.

### 12:30pm – 1:00pm
**Arthur Howe / Abdolmohamad Rostami**

We are developing the first disease-halting therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), which could also apply to other autoimmune diseases. Our strategy utilizes oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles containing multiple myelin antigens, aiming to induce immune tolerance and treat MS without the severe side effects of current immunosuppressive drugs.

### 1:00pm – 1:30pm
**Christoph Ellebrecht**

My research focuses on understanding and manipulating immune cells for precision cellular immunotherapies. In particular, we aim to target tissue-resident T cells, which contribute to chronic autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. Using genome engineering and high-throughput screening, we have identified novel therapeutic targets that could dislodge these cells, offering potential cures.
